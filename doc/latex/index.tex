The engine is based around an {\itshape Entity Component System} (E\+CS), and allows queries loosely inspired by relational database systems. There are several important concepts in the engine\+:\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Components}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
A component in the system is a {\itshape data structure}, which captures some information about an /entity/ (see below). Often, components are a part of many entities. Consider the example of a goblin enemy -\/ it may contain the following components\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Kinematic -\/ storing the position and velocity of the goblin
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structCreature}{Creature}} -\/ a standard stat-\/block\+: stores health, dexterity, etc.
\item Inventory -\/ a standard data-\/structure which describes what a creature is holding (and where)
\item AI -\/ describes variables which effect the behaviour of our entity.
\end{DoxyItemize}

This would likely be a subset of all possible components an entity could have, e.\+g. there may also be {\bfseries{Material}}, {\bfseries{Abilities}} and {\bfseries{Memories}}. In this case, an enemy would be a record with N\+U\+LL entries in those locations. Because components are user-\/defined, we use the {\ttfamily register\+\_\+component} method. It is important to note that we {\itshape must} register all components before use else undefined behaviour ensues. Attempting to do this returns an error if the D\+E\+B\+UG variable is defined.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Entities}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
