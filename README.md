# Enigma
This is a one-person  project. It exists primarily as a means for me (the author) to experiment with/learn
various 3D/simulation techniques. The core 'engine' is a simple ECS for memory managment, with several systems build
on-top (rendering, collision, etc.). Feel free to copy/use the code in any way you like, happy coding!


# Experiments / TODO
+ [x] Basic Phong Shaders
+ [ ] SAT collision detection for non axis-aligned boxes
+ [ ] Constraint equation solver/system
+ [ ] Portals/Masking 
+ [ ] Advanced Lighting
+ [ ] Load models from files
